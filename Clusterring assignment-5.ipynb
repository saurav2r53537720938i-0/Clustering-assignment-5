    "A contigency matrix also know as a confussion matrix is a table used to evluate the perfomance of a classfication model it compares the actual outcomes with the predicted outcomes with the predicted actual outcomes it typically 2*2 matrix for binary classfication with four outcomes true postive true negative false postive and false negative"

    "A pair confussion matrix extends the tradtional confussion matrix to handle the comprsion between two classfiers instead of just one instead of a 2*2 matrix it typicaly the four qudrants of the matrix reprsent the combinations of predctions made by two classfiers. The type of matrix can be useful in situations where you want to compare the performance of twoo diffrent classfication model or algorthims it helps in understanding how their predction allign  and where they differ providing insight into their strngth and weakness addtionally it can aid in ensemble learning  techniques or in situations where you want to asses the aggrement between multiple classfiiers"
